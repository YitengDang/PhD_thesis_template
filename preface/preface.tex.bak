Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. \\
Imagination is more important than knowledge. \\
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. \\
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving. \\
God does not play dice with the universe. \\
I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
